trial: 1

# Dataset, can use FEMNIST, EUROSAT, CIFAR10 
dataset: "FEMNIST"

# Algorithm (Currently list from:)
# - "fedAvgSat"
# - "fedAvg2Sat" (with scheduling)
# - "fedAvg3Sat" (with scheduling and intra sat links, use for clients of 10+ on one cluster)

# - "fedBuff3Sat" (with scheduling and intra sat links, use for clients of 10+ on one cluster)
# - "AutoFLSat" (still has bugs)
# - "AutoFL2Sat" (Proper hierarchical framework)
